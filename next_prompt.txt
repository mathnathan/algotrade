Great. I have set up the project.

1. The devcontainer is now built
2. The database and tables are created

I made a few modifications:

Added this to the pyproject.toml file

name = "algotrade"
....
....
# Tell hatchling where our package is
[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src"]

I set connection method for local to 'trust' in my hba file. So my DATABASE_URL is now

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://trading_user@localhost:5432/trading_db

With these modifications, let's now move on to Phase 2!
